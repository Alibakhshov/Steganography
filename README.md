# Steganography in Java 

Steganography is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video. The word steganography combines the Greek words steganos (στεγανός), meaning "covered or protected", and graphein (γράφειν), meaning "writing". The first recorded use of the term steganography was in 1499, by Johannes Trithemius in his Steganographia, a treatise on cryptography and steganography, disguised as a book on magic.
